## a simple DataBase Search project for Newbies


</div>

### Description

This sample project will show you how to easily structure a query to a DataBase.

The sample uses the NWND.MDB that ship by default with VB5 and 6 and demonstrates on a searchform how to search on a text from a textBox and use the different comparison operators like =,>,LIKE, etc.

NOTE: This is for total newbies that have a hard time figuring this out. I myself had a hardtime in the doc to get an easy explanation on this.

Cheers, and hope you enjoy.
